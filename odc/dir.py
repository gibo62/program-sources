# Python program to explain os.scandir() method 
 
# importing os module 
import os
 
 
# Directory to be scanned
path = 'd:'
 
# Scan the directory and get
# an iterator of os.DirEntry objects
# corresponding to entries in it 
# using os.scandir() method
obj = os.scandir(path)
 
# List all files and directories 
# in the specified path
print("Files and Directories in '% s':" % path)
for entry in obj :
    if entry.is_dir() or entry.is_file():
        print(entry.name)
 
 
# entry.is_file() will check
# if entry is a file or not and
# entry.is_dir() method will
# check if entry is a
# directory or not. 
 
 
# To Close the iterator and
# free acquired resources
# use scandir.close() method
obj.close()
 
# scandir.close() method is called automatically
# when the iterator is exhausted
# or garbage collected, or 
# when an error happens during iterating.
